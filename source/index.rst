Welcome to OpenSophia Knowledge Base!
=====================================

**OpenSophia** is the knowledge base project initiated by `TrimLAB <https://trimlab.psu.ac.th/>`_ team and our colleagues at 
Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Prince of Songkla University, Thailand.
This knowledge base includes *(hopefully)* all basic and practical knowledge you need
to get started with your researches and projects: 

*  :ref:`Logic, Statistics, and Measurement (LSM) <doc_stat-main>` is basically the data analytic skills which are
   the most fundemental skills for conducting researches, geniunely proving your hypothesis with data.
*  `Linear Algebra <linalg/index.html>`_ is the most fundamental mathematics for understanding advanced statistic and 
   architecture of machine learning and deep learning algotrithm.

.. note::

   This project is under active development.
