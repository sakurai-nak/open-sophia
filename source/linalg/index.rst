Welcome to OpenSophia Knowledge Base!
=====================================

**OpenSophia** is the knowledge base project initiated by `TrimLAB <https://trimlab.psu.ac.th/>`_ team and our colleagues at 
Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Prince of Songkla University, Thailand.
This knowledge base includes *(hopefully)* all basic and practical knowledge you need
to get started with your researches and projects.

.. math::

   (a + b)^2  &=  (a + b)(a + b) \\
              &=  a^2 + 2ab + b^2

.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{eqnarray}
      y    & = & ax^2 + bx + c \\
      f(x) & = & x^2 + 2xy + y^2
   \end{eqnarray}

**Lumache** (/lu'make/) is a Python library for cooks and food lovers that
creates recipes mixing random ingredients.  It pulls data from the `Open Food
Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_ and offers a *simple* and
*intuitive* API.

   This project is under active development.
