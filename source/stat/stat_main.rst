LSM: Logic, Statistics, and Measurement
=======================================

**Logic, Statistics, and Measurement (LSM)** is the fundamental course for data analysts, those who 
focusing on finding the truth from data. In this matter, it is important that we know how
logic and biases, how to gather data and measure things, and how do we interpret the statistical
analytic results professionally. Noted that overclaiming or misinterpret results are considered
malpractice: humanity will get nothing from you, and you might lose reputation yourself.

In every session, we try to give you a very practical usage and code for the calculation or tests.
Then, the descriptive explanation for you better understanding and mathematical proof will be given
respectively. We encourage you to give a further reading if necessary.
